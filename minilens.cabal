name:     minilens
version:  1.0.0.2
synopsis: A minimalistic lens library, providing only the simplest, most basic lens functionality.
description:         
    .
    Lenses satisfy the properties of the Category type class, and are used
    to inspect and update individual elements of a data structue in a type-safe
    way. This library provides the simplest possible data types satisfying
    these properties.
    .
    The "minilens" package aims to provide a very simple improvement on
    Haskell's record syntax: the idea of composable record accessors
    called 'Lens'es.
    .
    As of yet, there are no fancy Template Haskell APIs for generating lenses
    programmatically; you are expected to write your lenses by hand. Some handy
    handy combinator functions are provided to help you do this.
    .
    This library was originally part of the Dao package, but has been branched
    into it's own package in the hopes that it will be useful in a wider
    variety of projects.
